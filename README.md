#Description
This repository contains a metabolomics dataset acquired from 70 healthy human subjects receiving 1 gm of niacin following an overnight fast. Plasma samples obtained at timepoints 0 (pre-dose), 2,5,8 hours following the dose. Samples were assayed using using an untargeted gas-chromatography- mass spectrometry (GCMS) based metabolomics (Fiehn Lab, UC Davis, CA). The GCMS platform measured a total of 395 metabolites (180 known and 215 unknown).

In addition, the R code, analysis plan and results are available in the Rmd file.
